## **Overview**  

The **eCTF Red Team Toolkit** is a collection of offensive security tools designed for the **2025 MITRE Embedded Capture The Flag (eCTF)** competition. We aim to develop **custom exploitation, reverse engineering, fuzzing, and cryptanalysis tools** to assess and attack embedded systems in a controlled and ethical manner.

We are a **team from Johns Hopkins University (JHU)** competing in eCTF 2025, bringing expertise in **offensive security, embedded systems, cryptography, and hardware hacking**.

## **Features**  

✅ **Custom Exploits** – Tools specifically designed for embedded system attacks.  
✅ **Firmware Reverse Engineering** – Extract and analyze firmware for vulnerabilities.  
✅ **Side-Channel & Hardware Attacks** – Investigate power, timing, and fault injection vulnerabilities.  
✅ **Secure Boot & Crypto Bypass** – Target weak cryptographic implementations.  
✅ **Automated Fuzzing** – Identify security flaws using dynamic input generation.  
✅ **Attack Automation** – Streamline red team operations with scripts and frameworks.
