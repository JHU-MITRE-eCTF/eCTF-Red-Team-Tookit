# Binghamton

## Pesky Neighbor

Binghamton's design encodes frame using AES-ECB which encrypt each 16 byte chunk independently. By shuffling the 16 byte chunks except for the first and the last chunk which are metadata header and potentially padded bytes, we tampers the order of the clear text decrypted, making the decoder in violation of security requirement 2 (The Decoder should only decode valid TV frames generated by the Satellite System the Decoder was provisioned for).
